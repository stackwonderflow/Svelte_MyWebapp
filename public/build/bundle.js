It is the second version of Underground, a console based game written in Python that I initially made for Code In Place 2021. I thought that I would improve upon it and make it into a flask based web app. But in the end, I decided that this used too much of my old work and I was spending too much time on it.

Super comfy and machine washable, not to mention water proof! Vessi shoes come in a number of different colors and styles, so they have a shoe for almost every occasion. I will say, the lighter colored styles do get dirty easily. Also don&#39;t put them through the dryer, be patient and let them air dry! <a href="https://vessi.com/">Vessi</a></p> \n    <h2>Lume</h2> \n    <p>Here&#39;s why: Lume is deoderant that I have found to be effective and safe for my sensitive skin. I&#39;ve used it for several years and do not plan to switch anytime soon. Lume also has several other products, including soaps and laundry products (I have not tried these). <a href="https://lumedeodorant.com/">Lume</a></p> \n    <h2>Hairstory</h2> \n    <p>Here&#39;s why: Hairstory is a haircare line that I really like. I use their New Wash, which is a replacement for traditional shampoo and conditioner. I don&#39;t need to wash my hair as often, and it seems healthier. The product is a bit pricey, but I find that I&#39;m spending less because I&#39;m using less product. <a href="https://hairstory.com/">Hairstory</a></p> \n    <h2>Ridge</h2> \n    <p>Here&#39;s why: Ridge makes wallets, rings, and travel accesories with a minimalist design. Their wallets in particular are compact and easily fit in pants pockets. I frequently give Ridge wallets as gifts, and have used them myself. The Ridge products I have used have been of good quality and stand up to the test of time. <a href="https://ridge.com/">Ridge</a></p> \n    <h2>SugarBunnyShop</h2> \n    <p>Here&#39;s why: SugarBunnyShop has super cute art prints, clothing, and much more! I often gift these products, and have a collection of SugarBunnyShop t-shirts. This online shop usually has lovely holiday items as well, so I tend to check it out around Valentine&#39;s Day, Halloween, and X-mas. <a href="https://www.sugarbunnyshop.com">SugarBunnyShop</a></p>',p=h(),m=l("div"),m.innerHTML='<h1>Media Recommendations</h1> \n    <h2>Dropout</h2> \n    <p>Here&#39;s why: Dropout is a streaming service that has a lot of great comedic content. I started watching because I really enjoyed CollegeHumor content in the past. I really enjoy Game Changer, Make Some Noise, and Dimension 20. They have so many different shows, and I&#39;d highly recommed trying a free trial (just be sure to cancel if you don&#39;t want to be charged). <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/">DROPOUT</a></p> \n    <h2>Fool &amp; Scholar Productions</h2> \n    <p>Here&#39;s why: Fool &amp; Scholar produces a number of really interesting podcasts. I personally really enjoy The White Vault, Dark Dice, and Liberty. These are all fiction podcasts that I would classify as residing in the horror genre. <a href="https://foolandscholar.com/">Fool &amp; Scholar Productions</a></p> \n    <h2>The NoSleep Podcast</h2> \n    <p>Here&#39;s why: The NoSleep Podcast is my favorite horror podcast! This podcast has a huge collection of horror stories, there&#39;s something for everyone (assuming they like horror). True to the name, a number of them have kept me up at night. <a href="https://www.thenosleeppodcast.com/">The NoSleep Podcast</a></p> \n    <h2>Rusty Quill</h2> \n    <p>Here&#39;s why: Rusty Quill is a podcast network that has a number of entertaining shows. I really enjoy The Magnus Protocol (The Magnus Archives) and Rusty Quill Gaming. The Magnus Protocol is a bit spooky and monstery, and Rusty Quill Gaming is just plain entertaining to me. <a href="https://rustyquill.com/">Rusty Quill</a></p> \n    <h2>The Philip DeFranco Show</h2> \n    <p>Here&#39;s why: The Philip DeFranco Show is a YouTubeoutube show and podcast that I listen to regularly. It covers a variety of topics (sometimes very YouTube / content creator centric). I have found it to be a helpful way to stay generally informed without too much effort. You can find it on YouTube and most podcast platforms.
