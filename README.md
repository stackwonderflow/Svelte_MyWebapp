# Portfolio_Webapp
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:  
This project is a svelte web app hosted on GitHub Pages. Initially, I was just going to make this project simply using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I decided against this because I wanted to learn a new webframework. The content of the pages took surprisingly little time when compared with getting all of the components to function as expected and  deciding on styling.
