    <h1>Products I Highly Recommend</h1>
    <h2>Vessi</h2>
    <p>Here's why: I have used these shoes for years, and they are my go-to for everyday wear. Super comfy and machine washable, not to mention water proof! Vessi shoes come in a number of different colors and styles, so they have a shoe for almost every occasion. I will say, the lighter colored styles do get dirty easily. Also don't put them through the dryer, be patient and let them air dry! <a href="https://vessi.com/">Vessi</a></p>
    <h2>Lume</h2>
    <p>Here's why: Lume is deoderant that I have found to be effective and safe for my sensitive skin. I've used it for several years and do not plan to switch anytime soon. Lume also has several other products, including soaps and laundry products (I have not tried these). <a href="https://lumedeodorant.com/">Lume</a></p>
    <h2>Hairstory</h2>
    <p>Here's why: Hairstory is a haircare line that I really like. I use their New Wash, which is a replacement for traditional shampoo and conditioner. I don't need to wash my hair as often, and it seems healthier. The product is a bit pricey, but I find that I'm spending less because I'm using less product. <a href="https://hairstory.com/">Hairstory</a></p>
    <h2>Ridge</h2>
    <p>Here's why: Ridge makes wallets, rings, and travel accesories with a minimalist design. Their wallets in particular are compact and easily fit in pants pockets. I frequently give Ridge wallets as gifts, and have used them myself. The Ridge products I have used have been of good quality and stand up to the test of time. <a href="https://ridge.com/">Ridge</a></p>
    <h2>SugarBunnyShop</h2>
    <p>Here's why: SugarBunnyShop has super cute art prints, clothing, and much more! I often gift these products, and have a collection of SugarBunnyShop t-shirts. This online shop usually has lovely holiday items as well, so I tend to check it out around Valentine's Day, Halloween, and X-mas. <a href="https://www.sugarbunnyshop.com">SugarBunnyShop</a></p>

    <h1>Media Recommendations</h1>
    <h2>Dropout</h2>
    <p>Here's why: Dropout is a streaming service that has a lot of great comedic content. I started watching because I really enjoyed CollegeHumor content in the past. I really enjoy Game Changer, Make Some Noise, and Dimension 20. They have so many different shows, and I'd highly recommed trying a free trial (just be sure to cancel if you don't want to be charged). <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/">DROPOUT</a></p>
    <h2>Fool & Scholar Productions</h2>
    <p>Here's why: Fool & Scholar produces a number of really interesting podcasts. I personally really enjoy The White Vault, Dark Dice, and Liberty. These are all fiction podcasts that I would classify as residing in the horror genre. <a href="https://foolandscholar.com/">Fool & Scholar Productions</a></p>
    <h2>The NoSleep Podcast</h2>
    <p>Here's why: The NoSleep Podcast is my favorite horror podcast! This podcast has a huge collection of horror stories, there's something for everyone (assuming they like horror). True to the name, a number of them have kept me up at night. <a href="https://www.thenosleeppodcast.com/">The NoSleep Podcast</a></p>
    <h2>Rusty Quill</h2>
    <p>Here's why: Rusty Quill is a podcast network that has a number of entertaining shows. I really enjoy The Magnus Protocol (The Magnus Archives) and Rusty Quill Gaming. The Magnus Protocol is a bit spooky and monstery, and Rusty Quill Gaming is just plain entertaining to me. <a href="https://rustyquill.com/">Rusty Quill</a></p>
    <h2>The Philip DeFranco Show</h2>
    <p>Here's why: The Philip DeFranco Show is a YouTubeoutube show and podcast that I listen to regularly. It covers a variety of topics (sometimes very YouTube / content creator centric). I have found it to be a helpful way to stay generally informed without too much effort. You can find it on YouTube and most podcast platforms. Note: It's a good idea to use a variety of news sources to get different perspectives. </p>
