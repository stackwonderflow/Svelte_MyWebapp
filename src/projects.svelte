    <h2>Undergroundv2</h2>
    <p>This was my initial idea for a final project for CS50. It is the second version of Underground, a console based game written in Python that I initially made for Code In Place 2022. I thought that I would improve upon it and make it into a flask based web app. But in the end, I decided that this used too much of my old work and I was spending too much time on it. This new version is better than the original, and has some bug fixes that escaped my notice in the original.</p>
    <h2>ConsoleArcade</h2>
    <p>This is a project I worked on with a friend for coding practice. It is a series of console based games written in Python. It includes hangman, tic-tac-toe, and several other simple games with ASCII visuals.</p>
    <h2>Underground</h2>
    <p>This is my final project for Code In Place 2021, which was the first coding course I took part in live with other students. It is a console based game written in Python. It is a simple adventure game where the player fights progressively stronger enemies until they run out of health and die. It is the first coding project I made that I was truly proud of.</p>
